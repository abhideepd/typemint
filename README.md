# typemint
Building a typeracer for tech blogs and learning and revising stuff. Because, I like to touch type almost like daily, good stress remover, so why not, utilize this time with revision and review!!


*update: while working on it, I realized, a lot of things, I don't need this. This was surprising. I realized, I touch type just casually, for context switching and relaxation purposes and I don't even really care or know, what I am typing, I just love the race and just do, while listening to music. And the last thing, I want is curated content, from twitter or whatever or analytics about which characters are causing me problems or which characters are my weak points. Whatever market size, this whole thing might have, I am just not connecting with this application anymore. Was a great learning experience though!*
